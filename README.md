### 🌱 About

Hi, I’m **bitnudge** — a learning-focused engineer who believes in building quietly, consistently, and incrementally.

Not a specialist. Not a guru.  
Just someone who keeps nudging forward every day, through curiosity, iteration, and documentation.

I believe in:

- Small, steady progress over overnight success
- Clear processes over clever hacks
- Building tools that I actually use
- Sharing what I learn — even when it's messy

---

### 🔧 Currently Exploring

- 🛠 Terminal tools & Python automation
- 🧠 ChatGPT-powered workflows for dev + docs
- 📦 Embedded & networking systems (Broadcom / MaxLinear / RDK-B)
- 🗒 Markdown + Notion for personal knowledge systems

### 🧩 Ongoing Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `toolkit-scripts` | CLI tools for engineering automation (WIP) |
| `dotfiles` | My macOS terminal + VSCode setup |
| `notes-public` | Curated knowledge bits from my personal system |
| `bitnudge.dev` | (coming soon) my digital garden and lab site |

### ✍️ Philosophy

滴水穿石不是力大，而是堅持。  
一點一滴的 nudges，就是我打造出整個技術系統的方法。

> “You don’t need to be loud to be consistent.  
> You don’t need to go fast to move forward.”
